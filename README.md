# VBA-Examples
This Github repository is a collection of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code examples and snippets for Excel and other Microsoft Office applications. The examples cover a range of use cases and functions, from automating repetitive tasks to data analysis and reporting.

**extractNumbers**

In this code, we're using a For loop to iterate through each character in the input string (inputString). We use the IsNumeric function to check if each character is a number. If the character is a number, we append it to the outputString variable. Finally, we write the outputString to cell B1.

Note that this code assumes that the input string contains only alphanumeric characters and numeric digits. If the input string contains other types of characters, such as symbols or special characters, those characters will be excluded from the output string.

**extractCityAndState**

Note that this code assumes that the state keyword is present in the address and that the keyword is spelled correctly. If the address does not contain a state keyword or the keyword is spelled incorrectly, the city and state variables will be left blank. Additionally, there may be other approaches to identifying the state in an address, depending on the specific structure and content of the address data.
